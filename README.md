    🔗 Agentic AI: Patterns for building AI agents (ReAct, Plan-and-Execute, Multi-Agent Systems) using frameworks like LangChain.

    👨‍💻 Low-Code/No-Code AI: Examples using tools like H2O.ai, Google AI Builder, MLflow, and Prefect.

4. Projects & Experiments (/Projects_&_Experiments)

    Small, self-contained projects to demonstrate end-to-end workflows.

    Experiment logs and findings.

🚀 Quick Start
Prerequisites

    Python 3.8+

    pip (Python package manager)

    (Optional) A virtual environment tool (venv, conda)

Installation & Setup

    Clone the repository:
    bash

[git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/CodethinkerSP/ai/)
cd your-repo-name

(Recommended) Create and activate a virtual environment:
bash

python -m venv ai_ml_env
source ai_ml_env/bin/activate  # On Windows: `ai_ml_env\Scripts\activate`

Install core dependencies:
A basic requirements.txt file is provided in the root directory.
bash

pip install -r requirements.txt

    Note: Specific tool guides may have their own dependency files located in their respective folders.

Running a Specific Example

Most folders contain a README.md with specific instructions. For example, to run an Ollama example:
bash
